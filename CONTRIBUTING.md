In general, unless recognized by the author of this resource pack and given permissions, it is necessary to contribute the project via pull requests.

### Getting started.

Please run ...

~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/Fogg05/CozyUI-Plus
~~~

to clone the original CozyUI+ repository. You can also use assets from CozyUI+ or CozyUI Ex resource packs.

and then run...

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/WhatDamon/cozyui-ex
~~~

to clone CozyUI Ex repository. 

### Making textures.

Typically, CozyUI's texture size is 3 to 4 times of the original, if you want to make animation you need a `mcmeta` file and lengthen the texture image file vertically, you only need to use Photoshop to edit with the available textures.

You may be looking for requirements to create a split UI, or a one-piece UI, allow additional coloring as well, but usually Inventory uses the original gray.

More on creating a resource pack: https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_resource_pack

### Test.

After exporting the image and placing it in the corresponding location, load the resource pack and open the corresponding user interface to see if there is any problem.

### Optimize.

If the size of a single PSD file exceeds **25MiB**, you can consider using **xz format (LZMA2)** to compress it after editing without directly destroying the layer data.
If the size of a single PSD file still exceeds **100MiB** after compression, the GitHub repository will reject the commit request and require the use of LFS, in which case you have the following solution:

1. Remove some useless layers, such as hidden layers.

2. Remove useless metadata (if any) from the PSD file.

3. Split the PSD file (especially for texture atlases)

For splitting PSD files, you need to make sure that the PSD is named something like `xxx.part1.psd`, and you need a documentation file named something like `xxx.psd.md` in the same directory as those split PSD files to explain how to merge those project files!
We don't use Git LFS unless it's necessary, so please contact the project owner in advance if none of the above options solves the problem of oversized files!

## FAQ

Q: Can I use software like paint.net to create or edit textures?

*A: Yes, but you need to make sure that you have converted the project files to PSD files and that you have kept the layers!*
